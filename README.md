geoserver-tiled-geojson
=======================

Repository for testing using a modified TileLayer.TileJSON and Geosever's WFS service to draw maps in the browser.

Uses modified code taken from https://gist.github.com/DGuidi/1716010, and adds support for using jsonp to retrieve the layer, and to draw perpedicular offsets for lines.
